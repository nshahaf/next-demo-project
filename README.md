## Next.js Server Components & Data Fetching Exploration

This project was created as an experiment to explore the features of the Next.js framework from the perspective of a React user. The main goal was to dive into Server Components and data fetching within the Next.js ecosystem to understand how these features enhance performance and simplify app architecture.

Through this project, I aimed to:

- Test Next.js server-side rendering and static site generation capabilities
- Experiment with server components for better user experience and faster loading times
- Understand how data fetching works in Next.js using both server-side and client-side methods
- Practicing responsive and maintainable UI layouts with CSS Modules
- Leveraging the seamless Vercel integration for easy deployment and scaling

Feel free to explore the project and check out how the Next.js framework makes handling data fetching, rendering, and performance optimization much more efficient.
